- 👋 Hi, I’m @SingleSourceStudios
- 👀 I’m interested in ... not sure yet, probably all the good stuff on github, but I guess Python, Ruby, Shellscript, Laravel.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... the basics, pardon me, but rather late than never, I started HTML5, CSS3 and a little bit of PHP, Im struggling with Javascript
-    I don't reall know what I want to achieve, any advice as to where I could start, what you pro's think is essential, 
     given the future is Blockchain, Crypto, NFT, AI, Machine Learning etc.
- 💞️ I’m looking to learn from anyone willing to teach me ... Happy to return the favour with my skill sets, in graphic design, branding, web, animation. 
- 📫 How to reach me ... info@singlesource.co.za
